## My process

- Apply semantic tags to HTML content
- Add CSS classes to each uniquely styled section
- Apply typography styles
- Apply Image & background styles
- Apply spacing (flexbox, padding, margin etc)
- Add media query for viewport breakpoints
- Tweek values until satisfied

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I wanted to learn some of the styling techniques outside of a CSS framework which I usually use. I improved my knowledge of many CSS layout features and used some improved my understanding of the various measurement options available.

### Continued development

Although the design can still be improved in functionality and scope I am happy with the design and I am keen to move onto one of the more challenging projects.
